[pytest]
# Disable pytest-django plugin by default for this project. The environment
# where tests run in CI or dev may have pytest-django installed; our test
# suite doesn't need Django, and pytest-django will otherwise skip tests
# with the "no Django settings" message. See README.md which documents
# an alternate invocation: `pytest -p no:django`.
